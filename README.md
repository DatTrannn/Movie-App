# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies to Watch 2.0 by Tuan Dat Tran

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Movies to Watch*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

I used the clock on Windows to track my assignment work, and it took me 5 hours 21 minutes to complete the assignment.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

I am most satisfied with my neatly code and main GUI program works perfectly without any errors. This is which I spent
the largest amount of time to complete. Besides, I also update that the Category input could handle lowercase.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

I am most unsatisfied with my Git commits because sometimes I forgot to commit when completed a function or method. It
has made some commits not in order.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

I could improve my coding time from previous project and by following the assignment guideline, the development process
becomes simple and goes the right way.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

I will try to code faster in the next project with about 4 hours. It might be challenging, but I could extend my limit
and coding skill.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

I used Stackoverflow and Geeksforgeeks resources to review some of the forgotten Python commands as well as take a look
at official Kivy documentation page.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

The main challenge with me is the Kivy usage. I have forgotten how to use some of its method, so I must have to search
on Google and refer to the Kivy Demo Projects.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

Classes significantly improved my development process because it provides an easy way of keeping the Movie,
MovieCollection object and methods together in one place. Therefore, it provides a clean structure to the code which
increases the readability of the program. Besides, it also helps me to reuse the code from class several times without
duplicate and makes the program more efficient.
